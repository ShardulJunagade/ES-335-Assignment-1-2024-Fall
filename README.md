# Human Activity Recognition (HAR) Project

## Overview
This project involves Human Activity Recognition (HAR) using accelerometer data. The goal is to classify human activities based on data collected from smartphones. The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, machine learning models, and prompt engineering for large language models.

## Project Structure
- **Data Preprocessing**: Scripts to combine and create datasets from the raw accelerometer data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizations and analysis to understand the data and its features.
- **Decision Trees**: Implementation and evaluation of decision tree classifiers using raw and feature-engineered data.
- **Prompt Engineering**: Utilizing zero-shot and few-shot learning for activity classification.
- **Data Collection in the Wild**: Collecting and analyzing personal data to evaluate model performance.

## Current Status

### Completed
- **Data Preprocessing**: The scripts `CombineScript.py` and `MakeDataset.py` have been successfully executed to organize and split the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Initial EDA has been performed.

### To Do
- **Continue EDA**:
  - Plot waveforms for different activity classes.
  - Perform PCA on various feature sets.
  - Calculate and analyze the correlation matrix.

- **Decision Trees**:
  - Train decision tree models using different feature sets.
  - Evaluate and compare model performance.
  - Analyze performance with varying tree depths.

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Implement zero-shot and few-shot learning methods.
  - Compare performance with decision tree models.

- **Data Collection in the Wild**:
  - Collect and preprocess personal accelerometer data.
  - Evaluate model performance on personal data.
